Hi, this project is done with minilibx-linux, you have to compile it with the makefile, remember that you also have to give the program via keyboard the input "Mandelbrot" or "Julia n¹ n²" 
without giving two values to Julia it's not going to work, an example would be ./fractol julia (x real) (i imaginary)

You can render beautiful fractals with it but its based on complex mathematics, I encourage you to investigate and learn on the subject because its fascinating.
Thanks for reading!
